This is a service to control the keyboard backlight behavior on Lenovo P and X series laptops (possibly other models).

It will ensure the keyboard backlight is on after boot and also turn it back on after the system comes out of a standby.

For now, there is no installer but you can manually install using the following elevated command:
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\installutil.exe "path\to\LBCService.exe"

NOTE: This was only tested using the LOCAL SYSTEM account for the service log on account.

This service will create a file called LCBServiceConfig.xml in the same folder as the executable. The path to
Keyboard_Core.dll can be specified/changed here, as well as the preferred brightness level and a user preferred
timeout which is only used by the "LCBServiceSettings.exe" application.  This runs as a system tray icon that
can monitor user activity and will send enable/disable the backlight as preferred.

As of now, there is no installer but I hope to have this up soon.  In the meantime, install the service as noted
above, drop the ":CBServiceSettings.exe" in to the same folder and add a shortcut to this in your startup folder.
