This is a service to control the keyoard backlight behaviour on Lenovo P and X series laptops (possibly other models).

It will ensure the kayboard backlight is on after boot and also turn it back on after the system comes out of a standby.

For now, there is no installer but you can manually installing using the following command:
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\installutil.exe -u "path\to\LBCService.exe"

This also requires that the Lenovo Vantage software be installed and that the Keyboard_Core.dll is located i nthe following folder:
C:\ProgramData\Lenovo\ImController\Plugins\ThinkKeyboardPlugin\x86\Keyboard_Core.dll

It is currently hardcoded but I plan on adding support for a config file so this path can be adjested as well as the brightness
level, which currently is hardcoded to "High".

Of course, if you have Visual Studio, feel free to change and compile as needed.
